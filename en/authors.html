            <p>Dr – Associate Professor INSA Toulouse</p>
          </div>
          <p>
Ion Hazyuk is associate professor at INSA Toulouse and researcher at Institut Clément Ader. He received the engineer’s degree in Automation System Engineering in 2007 from Technical University of Cluj-Napoca (Romania), and the Ph.D degree in thermal science and energetics in 2011 from INSA Lyon. In the past he worked on optimal control of thermal energy in buildings and his current research topic focuses on thermal and dynamic modelling for systems simulation and design. His teaching activities cover linear dynamic systems, control engineering, mechatronics and thermal systems. </p>
